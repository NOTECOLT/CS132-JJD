          <h2 id="background">Background of the Study</h2>
          <p>
            Currently, 80% of Filipinos living in urban areas rely on public
            transportation. In Metro Manila alone, 70% of people are dependent
            on public transportation to get from place to place. Every day, the
            number of commuters who ride jeepneys and buses are 8,959,000 and
            1,865,000, respectively.
            <br /><br />
            While there may be other factors as to why Filipinos choose to
            commute, the main benefit of public transportation is how much more
            affordable it is compared to the cost of owning a private vehicle
            and constantly spending money on fuel, maintenance, and parking
            fees. According to a 2018 Consumer Finance Survey, the monthly
            expenditure level in Metro Manila was at P27,507/month. Of this,
            10.5% was spent on transportation. Most Filipino commuters are from
            low to middle income classes. The minimum wage in the Philippines
            varies per province with Metro Manila having the highest amount at
            P610/day or around P18,300/month; thus, it is difficult for many to
            allocate such a large budget for transportation.
            <br /><br />
            After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the price of gas and fuel surged
            worldwide. The Department of Energy released data that showing that
            77.4% of its gas, 80% of its diesel and 84% of its kerosene are
            imported by the Philippines. As a result, the global increase in gas
            prices have led to the significant increase of local gas prices,
            which has also largely added to the financial burden of Filipinos.

              Many Filipinos are reliant on public transportation as a means to

            The data set as a whole is massive, as it lists the Consumer Price

            Given the scope of our study, we will perform modifications onto the
            data set, which includes reformatting it as a whole followed by

        <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
        <p>
          Now that our data set is cleaned and well-formatted, we can now
          proceed to exploratory data analysis. Essentially, this step involves
          creating (clear) visualizations to help us understand the data, and
          using this information to determine if our established hypotheses are
          correct. Following this, we will perform hypothesis testing to see
          what results we can derive from the data.

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <div class="flex-container" id="insights">
        By the end of our exploratory data analysis and machine learning phases,
        we have gathered the following insights:
        <div id="insight">
          The <span class="bold">CPI of all transportation groups</span> seem to
          be going <span class="bold">upward over the years</span>.
          Nevertheless, it occurs in such a way where the CPI values
          continuously increase until they "plateau" and increase again after
          some period of time.
        </div>
        <div id="insight">
          The <span class="bold">CPI of passenger transportation</span> has
          <span class="bold"
            >significantly increased over the past five years</span
          >.
        </div>
        <div id="insight">
          The
          <span class="bold">CPI for both fuel and land transportation</span>
          seem to have been going upwards from 2019 to 2023, albeit at
          <span class="bold">different rates</span>. In particular, the CPI for
          fuel fluctuates, whereas the CPI for land transportation is relatively
          more stable. However, the
          <span class="bold"
            >CPI of of fuel may experience a continued dip over 2024</span
          >, as concluded by our machine learning model. It is unsure whether
          the sudden spike and fall in CPI fuel during 2022 is merely a fluke or
          if the trend is definitely going in this direction.

        <h2>Implications</h2>
        <p>
          After performing exploratory data analysis and creating a machine
          learning model on our data set, we managed to attain valuable insights
          with regard to the transportation scene in the Philippines. To be
          specific, we found that the CPI of Land Transportation in the
          Philippines has significantly increased from 2019 to 2023.
          Furthermore, subsequent regression analysis also concluded that this
          trend may further increase throughout 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our exploratory data analysis also found a correlation between the CPI
          of land transportation and CPI of fuel from 2019 to 2023. Both values
          have been seen to increase alongside each other throughout the past
          five years. However, due to the current trend of the CPI of fuel,
          there is a possibility of it decreasing in 2024, as concluded from
          regression analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the future state of the price of fuel and land transportation is
          not certain without further economic analysis on the national and
          global scales, overall these insights tell us that the situation of
          the transportation system in the Philippines is in a less-than-ideal
          state. This is mostly because transportation prices seem to be going
          up continuously, which will eventually become a big burden to
          Filipinos. This issue is already quite apparent in the Philippines
          based on our research. Essentially, being aware of this fact can serve
          as a wake-up call for agencies such as the DOTr, allowing them to
          implement policies that may reduce the rate of rising fuel prices.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="flex-container" id="future">
        <h2>Future Recommendations</h2>
        <p>
          While insightful, we have some recommendations for those who wish to
          work on something similar in the future. In particular, we recommend
          that they take confounding variables more into consideration to ensure
          that associations are made correctly. Correlations between the CPI of
          transportation and other factors such as changes in government
          policies and subsidies and the overall trend of cost of living may
          prove to be beneficial in further research.
