      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <h2 id="background">Background of the Study</h2>
      <p>
        Currently, 80% of Filipinos living in urban areas rely on public
        transportation. In Metro Manila alone, 70% of people are dependent on
        public transportation to get from place to place. Every day, the number
        of commuters who ride jeepneys and buses are 8,959,000 and 1,865,000,
        respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        While there may be other factors as to why Filipinos choose to commute,
        the main benefit of public transportation is how much more affordable it
        is compared to the cost of owning a private vehicle and constantly
        spending money on fuel, maintenance, and parking fees. According to a
        2018 Consumer Finance Survey, the monthly expenditure level in Metro
        Manila was at P27,507/month. Of this, 10.5% was spent on transportation.
        Most Filipino commuters are from low to middle income classes. The
        minimum wage in the Philippines varies per province with Metro Manila
        having the highest amount at P610/day or around P18,300/month; thus, it
        is difficult for many to allocate such a large budget for
        transportation.
      </p>
      <p>
        After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the price of gas and fuel surged
        worldwide. The Department of Energy released data that showing that
        77.4% of its gas, 80% of its diesel and 84% of its kerosene are imported
        by the Philippines. As a result, the global increase in gas prices have
        led to the significant increase of local gas prices, which has also
        largely added to the financial burden of Filipinos.

      <h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Many Filipinos are reliant on public transportation as a means to travel
        to different destinations. Because of this, they are heavily affected by
        changes in its prices.
      </p>
      <h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
      <p>
        Through data science, the group aims to draw insights regarding the
        state of public transportation prices in the Philippines and its
        implications to Filipino commuters.
      </p>

      <h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>

      <h1>Data</h1>

      <h2>Data Collection</h2>
      <p>
        To address the overarching problem and the proposed research questions,
        our group opted to utilize the data set entitled
        <a
          href="https://openstat.psa.gov.ph/PXWeb/pxweb/en/DB/DB__2M__PI__CPI__2018/0012M4ACP09.px/?rxid=3d158327-2848-4f4e-98a5-daeb59818b9e"
          target="_blank"
          >“Consumer Price Index for All Income Households by Commodity Group
          (2018=100): January 2018 - March 2024”</a
        >
        data set found on the
        <a href="https://openstat.psa.gov.ph/" target="_blank"
          >OpenStat website</a
        >
        , an initiative made by the
        <a href="https://psa.gov.ph/" target="_blank"
          >Philippine Statistics Authority</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        The data set as a whole is massive, as it lists the Consumer Price Index
        (CPI) of various commodities under different commodity groups, wherein
        the CPI is computed based on the province or region monthly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given the scope of our study, we will perform modifications onto the
        data set, which includes reformatting it as a whole followed by
        preprocessing. Details about our data set will be presented below.
      </p>

      <h3>About the data set</h3>
      <p>
        After performing preprocessing and reformatting, our data set now
        contains a total of 44850 entries. Moreover, the data set now has five
        columns instead of just two, which was found in the raw data set. From
        left to right, these columns are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Geolocation</li>
        <li>Commodity Description</li>
        <li>CPI</li>
        <li>Year</li>
        <li>Month</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In this case, the years we consider are the years 2019 to 2023, since we
        specifically wanted to know the transportation situation in the past
        five years. It is worth noting that the year 2024 was not considered as
        data for this year is still incomplete. The months we consider are
        January to December with an additional average value. This aside, since
        every entry represents a totally different CPI value, no sampling method
        will be used here.

      <div class="card-container">
        <div class="card procedure">
          <h4 class="procedure-header">Step 0: Preparation of the Data set</h4>
          <div class="card-content">
            At this step, we first extracted the relevant data from the original
            data set. After doing so, we manually removed excess rows and filled
            in the missing Geolocation and Year entries. We then restructured
            the data set into a different format to make data access easier.

          <div class="card-content">
            After preparing our data set, we now perform preprocessing to ensure
            that the data is clean and consistent. As we performed this step, we
            found that only the CPI column has null values and performed some
            steps to ensure that such is addressed. Entries with null CPI may
            either be dropped or replaced by an aggregate value depending how
            many entries of the same Geolocation are also null. In the end, all
            the CPI values are converted into floats as they are initially in
            string format.

      <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
      <p>
        Now that our data set is cleaned and well-formatted, we can now proceed
        to exploratory data analysis. Essentially, this step involves creating
        (clear) visualizations to help us understand the data, and using this
        information to determine if our established hypotheses are correct.
        Following this, we will perform hypothesis testing to see what results
        we can derive from the data.
      </p>
      <h3>Data Visualization</h3>
      <p>
        For this study, we conceptualized three different plots that aim to help
        us answer our Research Questions, and understand our project in a visual
        manner.
      </p>
      <div class="card-container">
        <div class="card procedure">
          <h4 class="procedure-header">Plot 1</h4>
          <div class="card-content">
            <img
              class="plots"
              onclick="magnify($(this).attr('src'))"
              src="img/graph1.png"
              alt="Plot 1"
            />
            <p>
              <span class="add-emph">Primary Research Question:</span> What is the overall trend of
              the CPI of public transportation over the past five years?
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              From our visualization, we can see that the CPI of all transportation groups seem to
              be going upward over the years. Generally, the CPI for all transportation groups seem
              to be continuously increasing until it plateaus on some maximum and will eventually
              increase again after some amount of time.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card procedure">
          <h4 class="procedure-header">Plot 2</h4>
          <div class="card-content">
            <img
              class="plots"
              onclick="magnify($(this).attr('src'))"
              src="img/graph2.png"
              alt="Plot 2"

            <p>
              <span class="add-emph">Secondary Research Question:</span> Is there a relationship
              between the CPI of fuel/gas and public transportation over the past five years?
            </p>
            <p>
              From here, we can see that the CPI for both fuel and land transportation seem to be
              going upwards, albeit at different rates. This suggests that they may be correlated to
              one another. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the CPI for fuel fluctuates,
              whereas the CPI for land transportation is relatively more stable.

      <h3>Hypothesis Testing</h3>
      <p>
        Following this, hypothesis testing was done to test the hypothesis made for each of our
        research questions.

            I'm Jasmin Pascual, a 4th year BS Computer Science student who has a
            passion for graphic design. Because of this, I would love to be a
            UI/UX designer in the future. In my free time, you can find me
            watching volleyball, playing sudoku, or exercising at the gym.

            I'm Jeanne Toledo, a graduating BS Computer Science student who
            finds joy in learning new things. In Computer Science, I
            particularly enjoy web and software development since it is where I
            can apply my learnings whilst adding my own creative twist. Other
            than Computer Science, other things that I like are Graphic Design
            and Winnie the Pooh
